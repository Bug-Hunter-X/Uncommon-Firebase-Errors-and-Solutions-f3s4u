To address configuration issues, double-check your `firebase.initializeApp()` call, ensuring that you have the correct and complete configuration object from your Firebase project settings. For multiple app initialization, use distinct app names and configurations.  Properly handle asynchronous operations using `.then()` and `.catch()` for promises, or `async/await` for cleaner asynchronous code. Always log errors for debugging purposes.  Consider using Firebase's error handling mechanisms such as the `onDisconnect()` method for database operations.
