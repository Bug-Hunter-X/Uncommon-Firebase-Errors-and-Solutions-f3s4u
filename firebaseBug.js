The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided configuration object is invalid or incomplete.  This can occur if you're missing required fields like `apiKey`, `authDomain`, or `projectId`, or if the values are incorrect.  Another common issue arises when attempting to initialize Firebase with multiple apps without proper configuration and naming conventions.  Incorrectly handling asynchronous operations like database reads or writes, leading to race conditions or unhandled promise rejections, is another potential pitfall.
